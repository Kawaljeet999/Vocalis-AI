# Vocalis-AI

Vocalis-AI is an AI-based web application for validating and predicting the emotion of animal sounds using advanced machine learning techniques and real-time frontend interaction. It predicts the **emotion** with **confidence score** and returns a **human-like phrase** based on the predicted emotion. It also supports **real-time audio analysis** for instant feedback.

## üîç Model Clarification

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript used for UI and audio upload.
- Animal audio file is uploaded by the user.
- User selects the target animal from a dropdown.
- Audio file name must match the selected animal.
- If mismatched (e.g. user selects "cat" but uploads a dog audio named "cat"), the audio is rejected.
- Validation handled using a Light BGM model that checks the audio-animal match.
- If valid, classification proceeds to emotion detection pipeline.
- MFCC feature extraction is done using Librosa.
- KMeans is used to cluster audio data by emotion.
- KNN is used to evaluate closeness of test audio to an emotion cluster.
- LSTM model is used for final emotion classification.
- Training accuracy: 97%, F1 Score: 95%
- Validation accuracy: 87%, F1 Score: 87%
- Real-time audio mode is included.
- Frontend supports dark mode toggle.
- Predicts emotion with a confidence score and provides a human-like phrase corresponding to that emotion.
- Supports real-time audio analysis.

- Locate and open the `index.html` file in a browser.
- Select the animal from the dropdown.
- Upload an animal audio file.
- If audio is valid, emotion is predicted and displayed.
- If unknown or invalid, audio is rejected.
- Optionally, use real-time recording mode for live predictions.
- Use the dark mode toggle for UI theme preference.
